            <h2>The role of a teacher</h2>
            <li>Teachers use a variety of teaching methods and materials to educate students about a particular subject area, providing specialist knowledge on this topic.</li>
                <li>A good teacher will support students individually as well as providing engaging lessons that bring their subject to life, to inspire and motivate their students to do well.</li>
        
        
                <h2>The responsibilities of a teacher</h2>
                <li>Teachers put in a lot of work outside of lessons to ensure that they are providing an engaging learning environment and supporting students.</li>
                <li>
                    The responsibilities of a teacher will vary slightly depending on the level that they’re teaching at, the subject they’re teaching, and the educational setting that they’re teaching in.</li>
